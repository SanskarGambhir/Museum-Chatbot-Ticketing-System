Acquired in 1980, it was once the most advanced tool for pilot training. The simulator replicated every aspect of the Boeing 747-200â€™s controls and operations, offering pilots a highly realistic flight experience. It was equipped with a six-degree motion system, using hydraulic jacks to simulate the aircrafts movements, such as rolling, pitching, and yawing.";

This exhibit combines visual and audio elements to recreate scenes from one of the world's oldest civilizations. It showcases important aspects of the Indus Valley, such as urban planning, trade, and daily life, through interactive displays.";
